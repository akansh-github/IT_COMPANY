                    <h2>Artificial intelligence</h2>
                    As the big guys scramble to infuse their products with artificial intelligence, other companies are
                    hard at work developing their own intelligent technology and services.<br>

                    The AI industry even broke records during the global uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, with
                    artificial intelligence startups raising $33 billion in 2020, according to CB Insights. With
                    investors clamoring and the technology cross-pollinating across countless industries, we've rounded
                    up 50 artificial intelligence companies and AI startups worth keeping an eye on.
                    xamples of artificial intelligence (AI) in pop culture usually involve a pack of intelligent robots
                    hell-bent on overthrowing the human race, or at least a fancy theme park. Sentient machines with
                    general artificial intelligence don't yet exist, and they likely won't exist anytime soon, so we're
                    safe... for now.<br>

                    That's not to make light of AI's potential impact on our future. In a recent survey, more than 72%
                    of Americans expressed worry about a future in which machines perform many human jobs. Additionally,
                    tech billionaire Elon Musk, long an advocate for the regulation of artificial intelligence, recently
                    called AI more dangerous than nukes. Despite these legitimate concerns, we're a long way from living
                    in Westworld.<br>

                    <h2>Web Development</h2>
                    Web development refers in general to the tasks associated with developing websites for hosting via
                    intranet or internet. The web development process includes web design, web content development,
                    client-side/server-side scripting and network security configuration, among other tasks.<br>

                    In a broader sense, web development encompasses all the actions, updates, and operations required to
                    build, maintain and manage a website to ensure its performance, user experience, and speed are
                    optimal.<br>

                    It might also, but not necessarily, include all those strategic actions needed to ensure its proper
                    ranking on search engine results. Usually, those tasks pertain to a different specialization, namely
                    search engine optimization (SEO)<br>

                    Web development is also known as website development, while the professionals that maintain a
                    website are called web developers or (more commonly) web devs.
                    Web development is the coding or programming that enables website functionality, per the owner's
                    requirements. It mainly deals with the non-design aspect of building websites, which includes coding
                    and writing markup.<br>
